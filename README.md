# Anagrammer
Song anagram solver

#### Use python scripts for the following:
  - spotify.py: download all tracknames from playlists. Requires clientID and secret for spotify developer application/account.
  - sanitize.py: Takes tracklist, removes special characters and concatenates song titles such as they can be searched on with the anagrams.
  - solveAnagram.py: python solution for solving the anagram, not a good solution that was found on stack overflow
  
Otherwise the app simply takes an input, searches the list "finishedSanitized.json" under assets and writes possible solutions. Refresh app to clear the solution list.
